Thoughts on the project structure: 

Threads and Roles:

Teller threads (3) that handle transactions
Customer threads (50) that request services
Main thread that coordinates startup and shutdown


Shared Resources:

Safe (limited to 2 tellers at once)
Manager (only 1 teller at a time)
Door (only 2 customers can enter at once)
Teller availability
  

Synchronization Requirements:

Customers need to queue when all tellers are busy
Tellers need exclusive access to the manager for withdrawal approvals
Limited access to the safe for both deposits and withdrawals
Controlled customer flow through the bank entrance

First full Implementation done. Output is not completely correct and the format is off slightly, but the main structure of the threads and shared resources is complete. 

To fix: 
1. Initial deadlock when customers tried to acquire tellers
2. Output formatting inconsistencies
3. Difficulty coordinating teller-customer handoffs

Fixed tellerAvailable semaphore initialization to start as available (permits=1). Fixed more semaphore initializations and I had to improve the customer queue management to properly signal the next customer when one leaves.
